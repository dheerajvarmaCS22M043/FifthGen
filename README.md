TCP.py:

Defines the TCPDevice class, which handles the TCP/IP communication with individual devices.
This class provides methods to connect, send data, receive data, and close the connection.
CommunicationManager.py:

Defines the CommunicationManager class, which manages multiple devices and facilitates communication with them.
This class can add devices, send data to a specific device, or communicate with all devices simultaneously using threading.
It abstracts the communication process, allowing the use of different protocols.
Protocol.py:

Defines a base Protocol class and a TCPProtocol class that extends it.
The base class provides a common interface for different communication protocols.
The TCPProtocol class implements this interface specifically for TCP communication.
Stub.py:

Defines a stub server that simulates a real device or server for testing purposes.
It listens for TCP connections, receives data, and responds with a simple "ACK" message.
This stub can be used to test your communication system without needing actual devices.
UnitTest.py:

Contains unit tests for the TCPDevice and CommunicationManager classes.
The tests use Pythonâ€™s unittest framework and the unittest.mock library to simulate device behavior and verify the functionality of the communication methods.
This file ensures that the components of your system work as expected.
